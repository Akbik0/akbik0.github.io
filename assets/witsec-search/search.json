I'm passionate about technology, design, and creative problem-solving. Most of what I do is self-taught, so excuse me if I make mistakes. I am mostly interested in photography and videography. Whether that be with my drone or my decade-old camera, I always try to capture the moment in the best lens possible. Below are some of the first photos I ever took on my DJI Mini 3, and I think it has been uphill from there. From when I was younger, I was always interested in technology. I would convince my parents to buy those cheap drones that never really worked out because it was always windy outside. I also convinced them to get cheap smartwatches that would operate at 2 fps. To be honest, this site is just a space to share what I'm working on and what I care about.
